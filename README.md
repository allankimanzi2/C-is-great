# Binary Tree Comparison in C

# ðŸ“Œ Project Description

This C program compares **three binary trees** and prints the one with the **highest number of nodes**. The comparison is handled by the `compareBinaryTree()` function, which receives pointers to the root nodes of the three trees.

# ðŸ§  Functionality

- Create and initialize binary trees.
- Count nodes in each tree recursively.
- Compare node counts across three trees.
- Output which tree has the highest number of nodes.
